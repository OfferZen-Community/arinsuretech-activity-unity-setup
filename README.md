## Build an augmented reality app on Root Insurance

# Activity: Getting set up with Unity and Vuforia

## Intro

*This activity should take you about* **1 hour to complete**, *but most of that time is unattended downloading and installing. Afterwards you'll be ready with everything you need to build engaging AR experiences with Unity and Vuforia.* **It's critical that you complete this activity before arriving at your Make Day, in order to get the most out of the experience**

In this activity you'll be downloading and installing Unity and Vuforia, and testing your AR setup with a sample project.

If you'd like some assistance at any point, chat to your team in the team channel on Make Slack and mention @dan.

## Process

### Step 0: Install Unity
- [Download Unity](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal). It's recommended that you choose the *Unity hub* option.
- Run the installer and make sure you have Unity 2018 installed.

### Step 1: Add Vuforia component and test your sample AR project
- Follow the [Vuforia setup instructions](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/getting-started-with-vuforia-in-unity.html)
- Note that instead of printing assets, you can display them on your cellphone - the image targets don't always work as well, but you'll get to try it out!

Now that you have Unity and Vuforia set up, you're ready to build world-class augmented reality apps! Don't forget to brag in your team channel. ðŸ˜Ž
